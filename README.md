# AetherStream Analytics Engineering

This repository represents a full **end-to-end Analytics Engineering practice system** built around the accompanying **Master Guide** and **Enterprise Practice Set**.

It is designed to simulate real-world business analytics workflows — from raw data ingestion to executive-level intelligence — using production-style datasets and problem scenarios.

The framework combines structured learning (via the Master Guide) with hands-on implementation (via the Practice Set), covering:

- High-scale ETL using Power Query  
- Dimensional modeling with Power Pivot (Star Schema architecture)  
- Advanced DAX for churn, retention, LTV, and fiscal intelligence  
- Predictive analytics (Regression, Monte Carlo, SPC)  
- Executive dashboard engineering  
- Automation using VBA and Python  

Rather than focusing on isolated features or formulas, this project emphasizes **system-level analytical thinking**:

- Designing repeatable ETL pipelines  
- Building semantic data models  
- Engineering business metrics  
- Applying statistical reasoning  
- Translating insights into decision-ready dashboards  

The **Master Guide** provides the technical foundation (Excel → Power Query → Power Pivot → DAX → Statistics → Automation), while the **AetherStream Practice Set** applies those concepts to enterprise-style scenarios such as multi-source ingestion, star schema modeling, churn analysis, forecasting, optimization, and KPI design :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This is not a tutorial repository.

It is a **practice-driven analytics engineering environment** intended to develop real-world capability — not just tool familiarity.
